(What's up?)\nTell 'em where you from!\n[Verse 2: MC Ren]\nStraight outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga\nMore punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger\nI'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this\nBut the pussy-ass niggas won't show this\nBut I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps\nIf not from the records, from jacking or craps\nJust like burglary, the definition is jacking\nAnd when I'm legally armed it's called packing\nShoot a motherfucker in a minute\nI find a good piece of pussy and go up in it\nSo if you're at a show in the front row\nI'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho\nYou'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to\nBut that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to\nA crazy motherfucker from the street\nAttitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit\nMC Ren controls the automatic\nFor any dumb motherfucker that starts static\nNot the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself\nEvery time I pull an AK off the shelf\nThe security is maximum and that's a law\nR-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw\nSee, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain\nThe definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'\nThat's taking place without a clue\nAnd once you're on the scope, your ass is through\nLook, you might take it as a trip\nBut a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip\nStraight outta Compton\n(Compton Compton Compton)\n(City of Compton, City of Compton)\n[Interlude 2: Dr. Dre]\nEazy is his name, and the boy is coming\n[Verse 3: Eazy E]\nStraight outta Compton\nIs a brother that'll smother your mother\nAnd make your sister think I love her\nDangerous motherfucker raising hell\nAnd if I ever get caught, I make bail\nSee, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem\nI see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him\nBut I'm smart, lay low, creep a while\nAnd when I see a punk pass, I smile\nTo me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving\nBut don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling\nLooking for the one they call Eazy\nBut here's a flash, they'll never seize me\nRuthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark\nExcept when I unload\nYou see a spark and jump over hesitation\nAnd hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration\nFeel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting\nBut leave a memory no one'll be forgetting\nSo what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!\nYou think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker\nThis is an autobiography of the E\nAnd if you ever fuck with me\nYou'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother\nWord to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton\n(Compton Compton Compton)\n(City of Compton, City of Compton)\n[Outro: Dr. Dre]\nDamn, that shit was dope!",

Never\nQuiet on tha' set - Yeah I like that better\nCause what I can do I think I earn respect\nAnd if I didn't from you, that's what I expect\n'Cause if it ain't ruff it ain't me\nSo who really cares how you want me to be\nSee, I'm just mean staying at the top of the pile\nAnd doin' soft note tunes it ain't my style\nAnd this concludes our program\nOf how N.W.A. makes a ruthless jam\nNow first we take an average drum\nGive it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb\nIt's no secret, that I sit alone at night\nPick up a pad and pen and begin to write\nAll kinda lyrics that's promised to play\nTo make everybody say\n[Sample]\n'They can be cold and ruthless no question about that\nBut sometimes it's more complicated'\n(Yo Dre)\n(You know what I want you to do?)\n(Bring that beat back, bring that beat back)\n[Verse 4: MC Ren]\nNow MC Ren is here working like super glue\nNo matter what I do, I'm always stickin' to you\n'Cause I'm the pusher, supplying the fix\nAnd this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix\nBut I'm making obstacles of enemy traps\nTo catch any MC's with the weakest raps\nCrucifyin in vain like just for usin' my name\nThe definition is pain, but that's the thing o' the game\nIf they try to retreat, I catch'em one at a time\n'Cause they're comittin' a crime, and still promotin' a rhyme\nSo, you in the back of me just listen and learn\nBecause you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn\nNow my assignment was to give a preview\nSo at my next concert I wanna see you there\nNot sittin' in a chair, standin' on both feet with yo hand in the air\nNow I'm about to jet out but I'll be back\nBut next time expect a more funkier track\nDeep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion\nWith lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion\nThe prove that I'm hype and you know that's bet\nNow continue to dance coz I'm thru with tha set",
